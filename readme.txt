== Description ==

Button Click Text is a really simple way for people using your form to see that your form is actually working when they push the submit button.

The "click text" will change from the original submit text to anything you desire. Some examples are:

Working...
Stand by...
Just a Minute...
Submitting...
Sending...

You can change the Gravity Forms submit button text to anything you want.

Changing the text for the submit button click text happens in the same settings area as the default submit button text itself. Simply install the add-on plugin, go to settings on your form and make the necessary adjustment.
